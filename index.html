      <h2>About Salmon Cookies</h2>
      <p> Salmon cookies combine two signature Seattle icons: Salmon and Coffee-time Confections.
      <br></br>
    Not only are these cookies shaped like the fish, but salmon is also a main ingredient. Don't worry - these cookies don't taste fishy. In fact, they are an ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever.
    <br></br>
    Our salmon cookies are for tourists and locals alike! Try them at one of our five locations today!</p>
